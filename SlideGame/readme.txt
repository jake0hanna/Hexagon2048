Hexagon 2048:

The only dependency is an up to date version of Java, just compile and run.


This project is intended to be MVC and general Java practice, 
it is the first part before I rebuild the game in js.
It lacks a nice UI, proper comments, more gamemodes/features, keyboard support, etc.,
but it is enough to start building the second part based on the logic and structure of this project.
AI was primarily used to bugfix and minimize repetitive coding, 
the only major feature it was used to implement was the Alias Method for randomizing tiles.
